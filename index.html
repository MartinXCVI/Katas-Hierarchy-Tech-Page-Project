          <p>Shorin Ryu is the oldest and most traditional form of Karate-Do. This martial art is mainly focused on punches, kicks, katas and weapons. It combines different elements from the Shuri-Te ancient style.</p>
          <p>And, of course, as a consciously structured system itself, it has a distinctive path to follow once you are an advanced student. Here is a list of its 9 main complex forms to learn and study rigorously: </p>

          <p>Adapted and improved by Makabe Chokun after being brought to Okinawa by a Chinese martial artist named Kushanku. It is the first advanced kata in Shorin Ryu.</p>
          <p>Characterized for its flowing style, open-handed techniques, and a wide jump with a flying kick. It is said that you would most probably need a whole decade of practice in order to master this kata due to its variety of twists, continous movements, proper coordination, and precise fastness.</p>

          <p>"Passai" means "surrounding the fortress". It is a highly strong and powerful kata which combines a set of flexible and rigid techniques, firm stances, and quick deflects.</p>
          <p>Modified and developed by Itosu Sensei, who added some extra defensive techniques against Bo attacks, and attempts of grabbing. It was Chibana's favorite kata.</p>

          <p>According to the legend, it is named after a Chinese sailor, or pirate, whose vessel crashed on the Okinawan coast. In order to survive, Chinto had to fight the local farmers and feed himself with stolen crops.</p>
            <p>One day, Matsumura Sokon was sent by the Ryukyuan King to defeat this stranger; Nonetheless, they were equally matched and stopped the fight after a long and tedious duel. Consequently, Matsumura asked the sailor to teach him his techniques and fighting style.</p>
          <p>Breath-taking and dynamic kata, with a number of unusual strikes of rapidly varying height, and a rare one-footed pivot. It demands the practitioner a high level of physical balance, coordination, and mental focus.</p>

          <p>In its techniques, we can appreciate a broad range of open-handed attacks and blockings, which give us a reflection about our art's Chinese origins and influence. Optimal cardiovascularity is crucial for a proper performance in this kata at full speed and strength.</p>

          <p>Similar to Kusanku-Sho, but longer and demanding more precision and fitness. One should have a certain degree of flexibility and speed in order to execute it properly and graciously.</p>
          <p>Martially ornate and eye-catching, this kata is broadly used in public exhibitions, tournaments and presentations. According to some historians, it used to be played in noble and democratic ceremonies for welcoming prominent figures and royalties.</p>

          <p>Meaning "temple ground", Jion is a robust type of kata with a prominent emphasis on basic stances like zenkutsu-dachi, uki-ashi-kuzutsi, and kokutsu-dachi. In addition with strong close-handed techniques.</p>
          <p>It is speculated that this kata and its varieties were developed and divided in the Jionji, the Jion Temple, where martial arts we famously practiced. From there, some believe that the Jion katas were spread into the Tomari region.</p>

          <p>Longer than Passai-Sho, similar in structure, but focused on softer techniques and fluent movements. Developed and improved by Matsumura Sokon.</p>
          <p>The Matsumura version has a distinct Chinese flavour, whereas the Oyadomari version is more "Okinawanized". It was further modified by Itosu, and is thought to have created a "shortened" (Passai-Sho) version of it.</p>

          <p>The oldest version of Passai. There is not so much information about this kata's origin or history. It is mainly practiced by Shorin Ryu and Shotokan schools.</p>
          <p>Bold and fast at first glance. Although, It is not to be underestimated for its short number of movements and techniques. One should have a fine precision during the twistings and an honest display of kime. You can learn this kata by the time you reach the category of 6th Dan, relatively.</p>
